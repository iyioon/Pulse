The Pulse prototype was developed using a blend of user-centered design principles, behavioral psychology insights, and usability heuristics. Below is a brief overview of the design process and the reasoning behind key decisions:

**Emotion and Motivation**: The inclusion of BPM (Beats Per Minute) as a gamified productivity metric draws from emotional design principles. By visualizing progress in real-time, the app reinforces positive behaviors, creating a loop that keeps users motivated and engaged.

**Feedback and Visibility of System Status**: Real-time updates, such as BPM changes and session progress bars, ensure users are consistently aware of their productivity. This adheres to Nielsen’s heuristic for keeping users informed about system status.

**Error Prevention**: The app includes options to correct user mistakes and exit pages such as tutorials. This adheres to Nielson’s heuristic #3: User control and freedom.

**Balancing Motivation and Avoiding Dark Patterns**: Motivational tools like target BPM and quotes were implemented with care to encourage users without coercion. Ethical nudges replaced guilt-inducing reminders to create a supportive and user-friendly experience.
